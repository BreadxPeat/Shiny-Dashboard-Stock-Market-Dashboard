# Shiny-Dashboard-Stock-Market-Dashboard

This Shiny app creates a dashboard that allows the user to select a stock symbol, the start and end dates, and the number of days for the moving average and RSI calculation. It generates a chart of the stock's price and technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, and MACD). The dashboard also includes a comparison tab that displays a pie chart and a bar plot comparing the chosen stocks.
